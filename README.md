Hardware: The project uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller with Nokia 5110 LCD, IR receiver, XY joystick module, and buzzer to implement a modded snake game with visual, audio, and input components.

Software: The game logic handles border and self collision detection, food generation, score tracking, and snake movement by integrating both IR remote and joystick controls to determine any direction changes.

Game Features: The game provides real-time LCD updates, grows the snake when food is eaten, declares victory after 20 food items, plays unique win and lose melodies, and shows the completion time for challenges.
